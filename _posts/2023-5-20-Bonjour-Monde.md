This took an embarrassingly long time to setup, given that I stole all this code from a (rather strange) bloke from the internet, which I confess is my trick for most things coding. The stranger the bloke the better the code usually, although fuck this cunt gave me the heebie-jeebies.


#### Pourquoi Exister?


Dunno really, I thought it would be good to have an outlet at night just for myself, it seems that otherwise the pit of darkness that's in my mind finds itself much too easily at the center of attention. Writing about mundane bullshit provides two solutions: I get to actively supress that bad voices while writing, and the bad voices are at bay while I think about what to write. An absolute win-win. reste à voir si je vais pouvoir tenir le coup. Je l'espère.

I ensure you that the posts to come will be embarrassing, most and foremost to myself both now and in the future, but I suspect future me will want to bring a cricket bat on my teeth even more than current me for the things that will be written here. Everything has a beginning, and frankly speaking that beginning is almost always a clumsy mess of naiveté and critical self-awareness for the slightest steps taken in any direction. Were adults toddlers, I guarantee you that the majority of us would not end up knowing how to walk. Toddlers have the advantage of not realising how pathetic their lack of walking skills are to us abled humans, and society has made it unnacceptable to laugh at such a dismal display of coordination for the good of those toddlers. I ask future readers to afford me the same privileges until the training wheels come off.

My main intention is to write about whatever may come to my mind, thoughts about society, books, movies, music, etc...

I hope to also use this to talk about my future area of research (that is, if my graduate school can be fucked to answer my mails). My ambition would be to write each week a small scientific biography on a specific researcher or lab, and the notable things that that lab has been responsible for. I recently more or less did the same thing for the current lab I am working in for the writing of my internship report, and was surprised at how simple it was, once a certain energy barrier broken. After that stage, you realise that the lab mostly just repeats itself, which means that with each paper read you develop a knack for reading and understanding the next paper.

I think it would be a useful exercise. Maybe you'll be able to find out the man behind the cat by piecing together the clues, research is a small world.

At the risk of sounding displaced and irreverent, I was heavily influenced by Aaron Swartz' [blog](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/) in the decision to finally make this blog. From his very first posts he displayed an acuity for writing and thought that would have been impressive for any adult, let alone for a 14 year-old. I see so often that people I would categorically describe as exceptional take part in some form of writing activity, so maybe they're doing something right in that regard.

I can only hope to imitate the giants, and maybe someday someone will stand on my shoulders.

#### Bonne lecture!
